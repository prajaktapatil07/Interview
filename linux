* What is the difference between Bash and Sh, and when should each be used?
-> Sh is the basic, original shell that works on almost all systems. Bash is like an upgraded version of sh that has extra features to make scripting and using the command line easier. we use sh for simple scripts that need to run anywhere, and use Bash when we want more tools and work on Linux.
Bash offers extra features that make scripting and command-line use easier and more powerful than the basic sh shell. These include:
Command history: You can press the up arrow to see and reuse previous commands.
Aliases: Create shortcuts for commands to save typing.
Arrays: Store and manage lists of values in scripts.
Advanced conditionals: More flexible if-tests with [[ ]].
Process substitution: Allows treating a command's output as a file, useful in complex commands.
Job control: Easily manage background and foreground tasks.
Command completion: Press Tab to auto-complete commands or filenames.
String manipulation: Built-in ways to modify text inside scripts without external commands.
These features help write shorter, cleaner, and more efficient scripts and make daily command-line work faster.

* How do you monitor disk usage and send an alert if it exceeds 80%?
-> I would use the df command to check disk usage percentage. Then I would write a shell script that compares the disk usage with an 80% threshold. If it exceeds 80%, the script sends an email alert to the admin. I would schedule this script to run hourly using a cron job by adding it to the crontab. This way, we get automatic alerts whenever disk usage crosses the threshold.

#!/bin/bash
DISK_USAGE=$(df / | awk 'NR==2 {print $5}' | sed 's/%//')
if [ $DISK_USAGE -gt 80 ]; then
  echo "Disk usage is $DISK_USAGE%" | mail -s "Alert" admin@example.com
fi

CRON JOB will be 0 * * * * /path/to/disk_alert.sh


Write a Bash script to check the health of a Kubernetes Pod and Node.
->
#!/bin/bash

# Function to check Pod health
check_pod_health() {
  POD_NAME=$1
  NAMESPACE=$2
  
  echo "Checking Pod: $POD_NAME in namespace: $NAMESPACE"
  
  # Get pod status
  POD_STATUS=$(kubectl get pod $POD_NAME -n $NAMESPACE -o jsonpath='{.status.phase}')
  
  if [ "$POD_STATUS" == "Running" ]; then
    echo "Pod is Running ✓"
  else
    echo "Pod status is: $POD_STATUS ✗"
  fi
  
  # Check if pod is ready
  READY=$(kubectl get pod $POD_NAME -n $NAMESPACE -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="Ready")].status}')
  
  if [ "$READY" == "True" ]; then
    echo "Pod is Ready ✓"
  else
    echo "Pod is Not Ready ✗"
  fi
}

# Function to check Node health
check_node_health() {
  NODE_NAME=$1
  
  echo "Checking Node: $NODE_NAME"
  
  # Get node status
  NODE_STATUS=$(kubectl get node $NODE_NAME -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="Ready")].status}')
  
  if [ "$NODE_STATUS" == "True" ]; then
    echo "Node is Ready ✓"
  else
    echo "Node is Not Ready ✗"
  fi
  
  # Check disk pressure
  DISK_PRESSURE=$(kubectl get node $NODE_NAME -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="DiskPressure")].status}')
  echo "Disk Pressure: $DISK_PRESSURE"
  
  # Check memory pressure
  MEMORY_PRESSURE=$(kubectl get node $NODE_NAME -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="MemoryPressure")].status}')
  echo "Memory Pressure: $MEMORY_PRESSURE"
}

# Main script
if [ $# -lt 2 ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 <pod|node> <name> [namespace]"
  echo "Example: $0 pod my-pod default"
  echo "Example: $0 node node-1"
  exit 1
fi

TYPE=$1
NAME=$2
NAMESPACE=${3:-default}

if [ "$TYPE" == "pod" ]; then
  check_pod_health $NAME $NAMESPACE
elif [ "$TYPE" == "node" ]; then
  check_node_health $NAME
else
  echo "Invalid type. Use 'pod' or 'node'"
fi

What is the difference between Bash and Sh, and when should each be used?
-> Sh is the basic, original shell that works on almost all systems. Bash is like an upgraded version of sh that has extra features to make scripting and using the command line easier. we use sh for simple scripts that need to run anywhere, and use Bash when we want more tools and work on Linux.
Bash offers extra features that make scripting and command-line use easier and more powerful than the basic sh shell. These include:
Command history: You can press the up arrow to see and reuse previous commands.
Aliases: Create shortcuts for commands to save typing.
Arrays: Store and manage lists of values in scripts.
Advanced conditionals: More flexible if-tests with [[ ]].
Process substitution: Allows treating a command's output as a file, useful in complex commands.
Job control: Easily manage background and foreground tasks.
Command completion: Press Tab to auto-complete commands or filenames.
String manipulation: Built-in ways to modify text inside scripts without external commands.
These features help write shorter, cleaner, and more efficient scripts and make daily command-line work faster.
